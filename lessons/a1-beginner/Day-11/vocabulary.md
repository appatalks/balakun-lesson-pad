### Activity Suggestion:
- **Discussion and Exploration:** Use this list in a discussion activity where the teacher introduces each word and the student describes or discusses what they know about it. This can be an interactive way to deepen understanding of each item and color, helping students to build sentences and use new vocabulary in context.

This format should make it easier for teachers and students to quickly view and reference the vocabulary during lessons or discussion activities.
