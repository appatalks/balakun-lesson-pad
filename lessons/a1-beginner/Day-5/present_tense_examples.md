### Examples for Present Simple Tense Conjugation

#### 1. **Using "He," "She," "It" (adds -s or -es):**
   - **He eats** breakfast at 7:00 AM.
   - **She goes** to school every weekday.
   - **It rains** frequently in the spring.
   - **She watches** TV in the evening.

   **Explanation:** For third person singular (he, she, it), verbs generally end in -s. If the verb ends in a consonant + y (like "try"), change the y to i and add -es (tries). For verbs ending in -ch, -sh, -ss, -x, or -o, add -es (watches, goes).

#### 2. **Using "I," "You," "We," "They" (base form):**
   - **I go** to the gym every morning.
   - **You play** soccer on Saturdays.
   - **We watch** a movie every Friday night.
   - **They study** English at the library.

   **Explanation:** For first person (I), second person (you), and plural subjects (we, they), verbs are used in their base form without any ending.

These examples and explanations can be used to help students understand how to correctly form sentences in the Present Simple tense, focusing on the differences in verb conjugation between the third person singular and other subject pronouns. This basic understanding is crucial for building correct sentence structures in everyday communication.
