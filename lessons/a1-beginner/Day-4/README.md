## Day 4 Lesson Plan: Learning About Ukrainian Currency

### Lesson Objective:
Students will practice English language skills by teaching the teacher about Ukrainian currency, using numbers and terms related to money, and conducting simple transactions.

### Materials Needed:
- Images of Ukrainian currency (hryvnia notes and coins).
- Role-play scripts adapted for transactions involving Ukrainian currency.
- Flashcards with vocabulary related to money transactions.

### Warm-Up (5 minutes):
- **Interactive Q&A:** Start with a quick interactive Q&A where the student asks the teacher what they know about Ukrainian currency. This helps set the stage for the student to introduce the hryvnia.

### Introduction to New Material (10 minutes):
- **Student Presentation:** Allow the student to present basic information about Ukrainian currency using simple English. They might cover:
  - Different notes and coins used in Ukraine.
  - Commonly used terms like "hryvnia" and "kopiyka."

### Guided Practice (15 minutes):
- **Teaching the Teacher:** 
  - The student explains how transactions are typically done in Ukraine.
  - Demonstrate how to ask for prices and negotiate using simple phrases:
    - How much does this cost in hryvnia?
    - Could you give me a better price?

### Interactive Activity (20 minutes):
- **Role-Play Transaction Game:**
  - Set up a simulated marketplace where the student acts as a vendor selling items priced in Ukrainian hryvnia.
  - The teacher, playing the role of a tourist or a local buyer, engages in transactions using the phrases and currency terms learned.
  - Switch roles if feasible to give the student practice in both positions.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes):
- **Writing Exercise:** The student writes out a simple dialogue depicting a market transaction in Ukraine, including how to make a payment and how to give and receive change.

### Closing (5 minutes):
- **Discussion and Feedback:** Discuss the student’s comfort level with using English to explain and transact in Ukrainian currency. Reflect on the accuracy of language used in the dialogues.
- **Homework Assignment:** Students prepare a short guide in English about visiting Ukraine, focusing on money tips, such as exchanging money, popular payment methods, and tipping etiquette.

### Assessment:
- Observe the student’s ability to correctly use English number vocabulary and transaction phrases.
- Evaluate the written dialogues for clarity, use of vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy.
