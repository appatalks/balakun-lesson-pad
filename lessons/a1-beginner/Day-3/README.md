## Day 3 Lesson Plan: Numbers 1-10 and Singular & Plural Nouns

### Lesson Objective:
Students will learn and practice numbers 1-10 and understand the basic concepts of singular and plural nouns to enhance their ability to count and describe quantities.

### Materials Needed:
- Number flashcards (1-10).
- Bingo cards with numbers 1-10.
- Worksheets for singular and plural practice.

### Warm-Up (5 minutes):
- **Number Warm-Up:** Begin with a quick interactive number review by showing flashcards and having the student shout out the number. This activates prior knowledge and preps them for more focused learning.

### Introduction to New Material (10 minutes):
- **Teaching Numbers 1-10:** Use flashcards to introduce numbers 1-10. Show each card, say the number, and have the student repeat it. To reinforce learning, pass each card to the student to handle physically.
- **Introducing Singular and Plural Nouns:** Explain the concept of singular (one item) and plural (more than one item). Use visual aids showing one object versus several (e.g., one apple, two apples).

### Guided Practice (15 minutes):
- **Counting Objects:** Distribute several small items (like pens). Ask the student to count them aloud and then describe the count using a sentence, e.g., "There are five pens."
- **Singular vs. Plural Sorting:** Provide the student with a mixed set of flashcards featuring singular and plural nouns. Have them sort the cards into two piles: singular and plural. Discuss any mistakes to clarify misconceptions.

### Interactive Activity (15 minutes):
- **Bingo Game:** Play a bingo game using numbers 1-10. Each student has a card, and you call out numbers randomly. This fun game helps reinforce number recognition in an engaging way.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes):
- **Numbers Worksheet:** Give the student a worksheet with mixed activities like matching numbers to sets of objects, and converting singular nouns to plural by adding -s or -es (e.g., cat to cats, box to boxes).

### Closing (5 minutes):
- **Review and Reflect:** Review the numbers and some singular/plural nouns learned today. Ask the student to say one thing they learned and one thing they found challenging.

### Homework:
- **Practice Worksheet:** Assign a worksheet that involves writing numbers 1-10, counting items in pictures, and transforming singular nouns to plural.
- **Real-Life Counting Task:** Encourage the student to count various items at home, write down what they counted, and whether the noun is singular or plural.

### Assessment:
- Observe the student during the Bingo game and the sorting activity to assess their understanding of numbers and singular/plural nouns.
- Check the completion and accuracy of the independent practice worksheet.
